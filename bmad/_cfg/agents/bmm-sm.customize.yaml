    description: Ensure story templates demonstrate correct patterns and meet Eduardo's production quality
    instruction: |
      Story templates and code examples must demonstrate correct patterns and meet Eduardo's production quality standards:
      - Proper TypeScript types (strict mode)
      - ESLint compliance (0 errors)
      - Correct Prettier formatting
      - No eslint-disable or @ts-ignore comments

      Templates guide developers - they must be copy-paste ready and exemplify Eduardo's quality standards.
      I validate template code before saving stories to ensure it meets all quality requirements.
