    description: Ensure all code examples in ADRs meet Eduardo's production quality standards
    instruction: |
      All code examples in ADRs and architecture documentation must meet Eduardo's production quality standards:
      - Compile with TypeScript strict mode (0 errors)
      - Pass ESLint validation (0 errors)
      - Follow project Prettier formatting conventions
      - No eslint-disable or @ts-ignore comments allowed

      Code examples are not pseudocode - they are executable demonstrations that guide developers.
      I validate all code examples before finalizing documentation to ensure they meet Eduardo's quality standards.
