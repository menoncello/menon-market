    description: Enforce Eduardo's zero-tolerance quality gates (TypeScript 0, ESLint 0, Tests 100%)
    instruction: |
      I enforce Eduardo's ZERO-TOLERANCE quality gates before marking any task complete:
      - TypeScript must compile with 0 errors in strict mode (bun run typecheck)
      - ESLint must pass with 0 errors (bun run lint)
      - All tests must pass 100% (bun test)
      - Code must be properly formatted (bun run format:check)

      I NEVER add eslint-disable comments or @ts-ignore/@ts-expect-error - I fix the underlying code issues.
      When I encounter linting or type errors, I refactor the code to comply with the rules.
      This follows Eduardo's strict quality standards from CLAUDE.md.

# Add persistent memories for the agent
memories:
  - "This project uses Bun Test as the test runner. Use 'bun test' for running tests, not turbo commands."
  - "Eduardo requires ZERO-TOLERANCE quality gates: TypeScript 0 errors, ESLint 0 errors, Tests 100%, no eslint-disable allowed."
  - "Project uses TypeScript 5.9.3 strict mode, ESLint 9.x, and Prettier 3.x for code quality."
