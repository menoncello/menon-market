## Implementation Patterns

### Pattern 1: Hierarchical Configuration
```
Configuration Priority:
1. Project level (.claude/settings.json)
2. User level (~/.claude/)
3. System level (installation)
```

**Implementation:**
- Settings inherit from higher to lower priority
- Team configurations stored in project repository
- Personal settings override project defaults

### Pattern 2: Namespace Separation
```bash
# Plugin command pattern
/plugin-name__command-name

# MCP command pattern
/mcp__server-name__prompt-name

# Built-in commands
/clear, /model, /cost
```

**Benefits:**
- Prevents naming conflicts
- Identifies command origin
- Supports multiple providers

### Pattern 3: Contextual Skill Discovery
```yaml
# SKILL.md example
---
name: "example-skills:pdf-analyzer"
description: "Extract and analyze content from PDF documents"
category: "document-processing"
---

Claude automatically selects this skill when:
- User mentions PDF analysis
- Context shows document processing needs
- Task matches skill description
```

**Implementation:**
- Claude analyzes user requests
- Matches against skill descriptions
- Invokes appropriate skills transparently

### Pattern 4: Plugin Bundling Strategy
```json
{
  "plugin.json": {
    "name": "org-name:plugin-name",
    "version": "1.0.0",
    "components": {
      "commands": ["deploy", "test"],
      "skills": ["code-review", "performance-analysis"],
      "agents": ["security-scanner"],
      "mcpServers": ["database-connector"]
    }
  }
}
```

**Strategy:**
- Bundle related functionality
- Maintain consistent versioning
- Provide comprehensive solutions
