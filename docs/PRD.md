# Product Requirements Document (PRD) - ClaudeCode SuperPlugin

**Version:** 1.0
**Date:** 2025-10-26
**Author:** Eduardo Menoncello
**Project Level:** 3 (Complex System)
**Status:** Ready for Architecture Phase

---

## Executive Summary

ClaudeCode SuperPlugin is a comprehensive AI-driven development ecosystem that transforms Claude Code from a coding assistant into a complete, self-building development team. The system enables creation of specialized AI subagents, dynamic skill composition, adaptive learning, and intelligent orchestration to achieve 60-80% reduction in development time while empowering solo developers to handle team-scale projects. Built on a "creators-first" principle where foundational tools (Agent Creator, Skill Builder, Command Creator, System Integration) enable the system to create any additional capability needed autonomously using Claude Code's native subagent architecture.
