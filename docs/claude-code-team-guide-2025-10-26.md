## Frequently Asked Questions

### Getting Started

**Q: How do I know which agent to use?**
A: Start with the default agent (analyst) for general tasks. For specialized needs, check `/help` to see available agents and their specialties.

**Q: What's the difference between commands and skills?**
A: Commands are user-initiated with `/command`. Skills are automatically invoked by Claude based on context and task relevance.

**Q: How do I create my own workflow?**
A: Create a `.md` file in `.claude/commands/` with YAML frontmatter and step-by-step instructions. See "Building Effective Workflows" section.

### Daily Usage

**Q: My workflow got stuck. What do I do?**
A: Try `/resume` to continue from the last checkpoint, or `/clear` to start fresh. You can also check `/workflow-status` to see current progress.

**Q: How do I share my custom agents with the team?**
A: Commit your agent files to `.claude/agents/` in the repository. Team members can then use them automatically.

**Q: Can I use Claude Code with existing CI/CD pipelines?**
A: Yes! Claude Code can be integrated into CI/CD for automated documentation, code reviews, and testing.

### Advanced Topics

**Q: How do I handle sensitive data in workflows?**
A: Store sensitive information in environment variables or encrypted configuration files. Never commit secrets to the repository.

**Q: Can I connect Claude Code to external databases?**
A: Yes, through MCP (Model Context Protocol) servers or custom skills that handle database connections securely.

**Q: How do I optimize performance for large codebases?**
A: Use specific file/directory references, focus on relevant code sections, and break large tasks into smaller, focused conversations.

### Team Management

**Q: How do we ensure consistency across team members?**
A: Use shared `.claude/settings.json`, maintain common workflows in `.claude/commands/`, and document team standards in shared documentation.

**Q: What's the best way to onboard new team members?**
A: Provide them with this guide, set up their environment with team configuration, and have them work through a simple example workflow.

**Q: How do we handle version conflicts in custom workflows?**
A: Use standard Git workflow with pull requests for workflow changes. Test workflow updates in a separate branch before merging.
