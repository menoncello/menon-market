# Story 1.3: Core Skills Implementation Framework

Status: done

## Story

As an agent creator,
I want to implement role-specific skill frameworks for each agent type,
So that agents have immediate access to their domain-specific capabilities.

## Requirements Context

Based on the Epic 1 Technical Specification and architecture document, this story implements the foundational skill framework that enables each of the 7 specialized agent types (FrontendDev, BackendDev, QA, Architect, CLI Dev, UX Expert, SM) to have immediate access to domain-specific capabilities. The implementation leverages TypeScript with Bun for optimal performance and integrates with Claude Code's native subagent architecture and episodic-memory for persistent learning.

## Project Structure Alignment

The core skills implementation must align with the established monorepo structure:
- `/packages/core/src/skills/` - Core skill system implementation
- `/skills/frontend/`, `/skills/backend/`, `/skills/testing/` - Domain-specific skill directories
- Integration with existing TypeScript configuration and strict mode
- Compliance with Bun-based toolchain and native test runner
- Alignment with quality gates and testing strategy from architecture
- Support for skill borrowing protocol and composition engine (future stories)

## Acceptance Criteria

1. **Core Skill Sets Definition**
   - Define comprehensive skill sets for each of the 7 agent types
   - Skills include UI development patterns (FrontendDev), API design (BackendDev), testing strategies (QA), system design (Architect), CLI development (CLI Dev), user experience (UX Expert), and project management (SM)

### Debug Log References

**2025-10-28 - Implementation Start: Core Skills Framework**

**Plan Analysis:**
- Existing foundation: Solid agent type system with `AgentDefinition` interface in `/packages/core/src/agents/types.ts`
- Target structure: Monorepo with `/packages/core/src/skills/` for core framework and `/skills/{domain}/` for domain-specific skills
- Context file provides detailed interfaces: `SkillDefinition`, `SkillRegistry`, `SkillLoader`
- Must integrate with existing TypeScript strict mode, Bun toolchain, and Claude Code Task tool
- 7 agent types need domain-specific skills: FrontendDev, BackendDev, QA, Architect, CLI Dev, UX Expert, SM

**Implementation Strategy:**
1. **Subtask 1.1**: Analyze existing agent definitions to extract role-specific capabilities
2. **Subtask 1.2**: Create comprehensive skill schema interfaces extending existing patterns
3. **Subtask 1.3**: Implement skill definitions for FrontendDev (UI patterns, component libraries) and BackendDev (API design, databases)
4. **Subtask 1.4**: Implement skills for remaining 5 agent types with domain-specific capabilities
5. **Framework Integration**: Build on existing agent system architecture, maintain compatibility with current patterns
6. **Testing**: Use Bun Test with ‚â•90% coverage requirement, create validation tests for all skill definitions

**Key Architectural Decisions:**
- Leverage existing `AgentDefinition.coreSkills` as foundation
- Create `SkillDefinition` interface with metadata, dependencies, compatibility matrices
- Implement skill registry with discovery and hot-reloading capabilities
- Use existing `CapabilityConfig` pattern for skill access control
- Align with established TypeScript strict mode and ESLint standards
