# Story 1.2: Directory Structure Generator

Status: done

## Story

As a developer,
I want to automatically generate modular agent directory structures,
So that each agent has a consistent, organized foundation for development.

## Requirements Context

Based on the Epic 1 Technical Specification and architecture document, this story implements the foundational directory structure generation capability that enables the Agent Creator system to establish consistent, organized foundations for all agent types. The implementation leverages TypeScript with Bun for optimal performance and integrates with Claude Code's native subagent architecture.

## Project Structure Alignment

The directory structure generator must align with the established monorepo structure:
- `/packages/agent-creator/` - Core generation logic
- `/agents/{agent-type}/` - Generated agent directories
- Integration with existing TypeScript configuration
- Compliance with Bun-based toolchain
- Alignment with quality gates and testing standards

## Acceptance Criteria

1. **Template-based Directory Generation**
   - Generate complete directory structures for all 7 agent types (FrontendDev, BackendDev, QA, Architect, CLI Dev, UX Expert, SM)
   - Each agent directory includes standardized subdirectories: `src/`, `tests/`, `config/`, `docs/`
   - Template system supports customization per agent type
   - Directory naming follows kebab-case convention consistently

2. **MCP Server Integration Structure**
   - Include MCP server template files in each generated agent directory
   - Tool definition schema compliance for Claude Code integration
   - Configuration files for MCP server setup and registration
   - Integration points for Claude Code's Task tool delegation

3. **Configuration Files Generation**
   - Generate `package.json` with agent-specific dependencies and scripts
   - Create `tsconfig.json` with TypeScript strict mode configuration
   - Generate `.eslintrc.json` with project-specific linting rules
   - Include `bun.lockb` compatibility and Bun-specific configurations

4. **README Template Generation**
   - Generate agent-specific README files with role descriptions
   - Include setup instructions and usage examples
   - Document core skills and specializations for each agent type
   - Provide integration guidelines with Claude Code

5. **Development Environment Setup Scripts**
   - Generate `setup.sh` script for automated environment preparation
   - Include development server startup scripts
   - Create test execution scripts using Bun Test
   - Provide validation scripts for structure compliance

6. **Claude Code Native Integration**
   - Ensure generated structures work seamlessly with Claude Code subagents
   - Include configuration for episodic-memory integration
   - Support for Task tool delegation patterns
   - Compatibility with slash command system

## Dev Notes

### Architecture Patterns
- Follow the established monorepo structure from `/packages/agent-creator/`
- Use TypeScript strict mode for type safety and performance
- Leverage Bun's native capabilities for optimal performance
- Implement template system using handlebars or similar templating engine

### Technical Constraints
- Must integrate with Claude Code's native subagent architecture
- Generation time must be < 30 seconds per agent (from FR001)
- All generated code must pass ESLint validation without rule violations
- Template system must support future extensibility for custom agent types

### Integration Points
- MCP server templates must comply with Claude Code tool schema standards
- Generated configurations must work with existing Bun-based toolchain
- Directory structures must align with quality gates validation requirements
- Development scripts must integrate with existing testing frameworks

### Performance Requirements
- Agent generation time: < 30 seconds per agent
- Memory usage: < 50MB during generation process
- File operations: Optimized for batch generation capabilities
- Template rendering: < 5 seconds per agent type

## Project Structure Notes

### Alignment with Monorepo Standards
The generated structures must align with the established monorepo pattern:
- Agent directories under `/agents/{agent-type}/`
- Consistent package.json naming conventions
- TypeScript project references for inter-package dependencies
- Shared ESLint and Prettier configurations

### Development Workflow Integration
- Generated setup scripts must integrate with existing development workflow
- Test configurations must align with Bun Test framework expectations
- Build processes must work with Turborepo optimization
- Documentation must follow established markdown standards

### Quality Gates Compliance
- Generated code must pass all quality gate validations
- ESLint compliance without rule violations (no eslint-disable)
- TypeScript strict mode compliance without any types
- Test coverage requirements alignment with project standards
