- **Version Specific**: Note version compatibility and deprecation warnings
- **Performance Considerations**: Include performance benchmarks and optimization tips

# Research Orchestration

## Parallel Execution Strategy
1. **Group Formation**: Divide sub-topics into logical groups of 5 related items
2. **Task Distribution**: Launch 9 parallel research subtasks for maximum efficiency
3. **Progress Tracking**: Maintain progress indicators for each research thread
4. **Quality Assurance**: Cross-reference findings between parallel tasks

## Research Workflow
1. **Discovery**: Identify primary sources, official documentation, and expert resources
2. **Analysis**: Extract technical requirements, dependencies, and implementation details
3. **Synthesis**: Consolidate findings into structured documentation
4. **Validation**: Verify accuracy through practical testing and community feedback
5. **Documentation**: Format findings according to the specified structure

## Success Criteria
- **Completeness**: All required sections thoroughly researched
- **Accuracy**: Technical details verified and current
- **Actionability**: Developers can implement based on the research
- **Integration**: Findings cohesively integrated across related topics
