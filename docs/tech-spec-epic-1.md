# Technical Specification: Foundation & Agent Creator

Date: 2025-10-26
Author: Eduardo Menoncello
Epic ID: 1
Status: Draft

---

## Overview

The Foundation & Agent Creator Epic establishes the core infrastructure for the ClaudeCode SuperPlugin ecosystem. This epic implements the foundational capability that enables the creation of any additional tool or capability within the system. Built on Claude Code's native subagent architecture, this epic delivers the essential building blocks for AI-driven development automation including agent type definitions, skill composition engines, MCP server templates, memory management, and validation frameworks.

The system leverages TypeScript for type safety and performance, with Bun as the package manager for optimal build times. All components are designed as modular packages within a monorepo structure, ensuring maintainability while supporting complex interdependencies required for multi-agent collaboration.

## Objectives and Scope

**In-Scope:**
- Implement 7 specialized agent type definitions with role-based capabilities
- Create modular agent templates with MCP integration for Claude Code compatibility
- Develop role-specific skill sets for each agent type (FrontendDev, BackendDev, QA, Architect, CLI Dev, UX Expert, SM)
- Build skill composition engine with compatibility checking and dynamic capability acquisition
- Create standardized MCP server template implementation for consistent agent behavior
- Implement hybrid memory system with agent-specific and episodic memory components
- Develop comprehensive validation framework for testing and quality assurance of agents and skills

**Out-of-Scope:**
- Advanced AI features beyond adaptive learning (self-modifying architectures, autonomous requirement discovery)
- External MCP server integrations (focus on Claude Code native capabilities only)
- Multi-tenant architecture and enterprise governance (handled in Epic 5)
- Advanced research intelligence capabilities (handled in Epic 4)
- Complex workflow orchestration beyond basic agent coordination (handled in Epic 3)

## System Architecture Alignment

This epic aligns with the core Claude Code SuperPlugin architecture by implementing the foundational components described in the architecture document. The implementation leverages the established monorepo structure and follows the hierarchical orchestration patterns.

**Key Architectural Alignments:**
- **Native Subagent System**: Implements the agent definitions and templates using Claude Code's Task tool delegation protocol
- **Monorepo Structure**: Follows the `/packages/core/src/agents/` structure for agent implementations
- **Hybrid Memory Architecture**: Integrates with Layer 1 (Agent-Specific Memory) and Layer 2 (Episodic-Memory Central)
- **Skill Management System**: Aligns with YAML-based skill definitions and compatibility matrix requirements
- **Quality Gates**: Implements the automated testing and validation framework for all created components

**Component References:**
- Agent Creator: `/packages/agent-creator/` package
- Core Skills: `/packages/core/src/skills/` module
- Memory System: `/packages/core/src/memory/` module
- Validation Framework: `/packages/quality-gates/` package
